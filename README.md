## Tennis_Elo
Project inspired from a coding test. The project that aims to discover the predictive power of an Elo model in tennis ATP matches and compare it with bookkeepers' odds.

## Description 

The Questions that we are trying to answer are based on the below:

1. We implement a standard Elo Ranking model based on the following link https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/tennis-elo-modelling/
2. Based on the model we compute the win probabilities for each game. We assess the model performance and compare it with the bookmaker prices. Assessment metrics are based on the 
following link https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/how-to-build-an-afl-model/ 
3. We assess the correlation between players performances on the different surfaces.
4. Based on the previous findings we implement a surface specific Elo model.
